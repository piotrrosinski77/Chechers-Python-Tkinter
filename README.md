# A Python-based Checkers Game using Tkinter and TensorFlow Neural Network
TkCheckers is a classic checkers game built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The project demonstrates the implementation of game logic, player moves, and GUI design in Python. Moves are generated by a neural network. 

## Features
- Traditional checkers gameplay with a graphical interface.
- Neural network-based move generation.
- Implementation of game logic and player moves.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piotrrosinski77/Checkers-Python-Tkinter.git
   cd Checkers-Python-Tkinter

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the application
   ```bash
   python warcaby/app.py

2. The game window will open, and you can start playing checkers.
